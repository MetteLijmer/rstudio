### Introduction

Track 1.
I found this track on a royalty free music website, called epidemicsound. I got a free description and that is how I could download the music. I searched specifically for a hardstyle song, because I listen to hardstyle a lot and the music means a lot to me, so that is why I chose this song.
Track 2.
I also found this track on epidemicsoun, a royalty free music website. With the free trial I could get an account to download music. I searched for trance music, because I really like trance and I am going to a trance festival this weekend, so that is why I am interested in this genre.
